CSS

1)  What are the four main component when considering CSS specificity?

    Inline CSS, ID identifier, class and pseudo-class, element and
    pseudo-element.

2)  If I have 1) ul#nav li.active a and 2) div.navbar li.active a.social
    which will have more specificity?

    The first selector will have more specificity than the other selector.

3)  What code can you put at background: black; to override specificity?

    !important

4)  What are the four elements in a box-model?

    Content, padding, border and margin.

5)  What are the differences between inline, block, and inline-block?

    Inline elements has no line break before or after it. It only takes up as
    width as it needs. Inline places all of your elements on a single line,
    and they don't maintain their "box" properties.

    Block elements has some white space above and below it and does not
    tolerate any HTML elements beside it. This makes the element a block box.
    It won't let anything sit next to it on the page and takes up the full
    width.

    Inline-block elements are placed as inline element, but it behaves as a
    block element. This makes the element a block box but will allow other
    elements to sit next to it on the same line.

6)  What are the differences between position relative and absolute?

    Relatively positioned elements will cause it to be adjusted away from
    its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any
    gap left by the element.

    Absolutely positioned elements will position the element relative to the
    nearest positioned ancestor.

    Statically positioned elements are as per normal, as it is a default
    option in most browsers.

    Fixed positioned element is removed from the normal page composition,
    instead it is now based on the viewport of the browser window.

7)  If I add the following CSS to position: static, what would happen?

    div {
      position: static;
      top: 100px;
      right: 100px;
    }

    Nothing will happen. Position: static is a default option on browsers
    anyway, and top and right options only work on absolutely positioned
    elements.

JS

1)  What are the four common data types you come across different languages?

    Number, String, Boolean, Object

2)  What is the method used to calculate 2 to the power of 2 and square root
    of 4?

    Math.pow(2, 2), Math.sqrt(4)

3)  What is the method to use to round down and round up a float?

    "hello".toUpperCase(), "hello".toLowerCase()

5)  What is the difference between null and undefined?

    Null is not a valid number or string, while undefined means that the
    variable is not assigned to anything yet.

6)  Given this array var cuteAnimals = ["cat", "dog", "hedgehog"], write two
    loops using xxx.forEach() and good old fashion for (var i=0.... to
    console log "I love cat", "I love dog", and "I love hedgehog".

    cuteAnimals.forEach(function (element) {
      console.log("I love " + element);
    });

    for (var i=0; i < cuteAnimals.length; i++) {
      console.log("I love " + cuteAnimals[i]);
    }

7)  Name 2 other methods, excluding example, that you can use on Arrays.
    Example myArray.toString()

    myArray.length, myArray.pop
